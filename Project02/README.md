# Web App
**IMPORTANT: The way the CSS is written, the program may not be optimized for mobile use. If the proportions of the graphics are wrong, or if they interlap with eachother. adjust the screen size to fix it. For example, on my 1366x768 resolution, the game best played at a 50% zoom out.**

My web app is a 2 player version of Tic-Tac-Toe. Player X makes the first move, followed by Player O who then alternate turns until the game is complete. Players click on the desired mark square (with a "-" in the center for clarity) within the 3x3 grid to place their mark (X or O) on the square. Once a square is marked, it can not be modified by either of the players until the game ends. The first player to place 3 of their marks in a row (either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins a point. If neither player is able to mark 3 in a row, the round ends in a tie. A tracker keeps track of the running points. A win nets 1 point, a draw nets none, and a loss nets none.

The game is written in Javascript, and the site is formatted using HTML and CSS.
